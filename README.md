# CookieLib

Simple, easy to use library for 1.8 Spigot servers(for now). This library includes NPC spawning with custom pathfinder goals, easy to use Packet Wrapper and listener.

## Why would I use CookieLib

If you are using only 1 or 2 dependency for your Spigot Plugin, you might wanna pick more lightweight options instead of CookieLib.
But if you want use just a single library that contains NPC library and Packet Listener you might want to chose CookieLib.
